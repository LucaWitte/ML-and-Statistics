# Machine-Learning & Statistics
Coding exercises from studying and implementing ML 

- Statistics and R:
  The code in the [Folder R_StatisticsLecture](https://github.com/LucaWitte/ML-and-Statistics/tree/main/R_StatisticsLectures) was created for [Dr. Jack Kuiper's](https://bsse.ethz.ch/cbg/group/people/person-detail.MjA3Mjc0.TGlzdC81MTYsOTQ0ODM3Mzc2.html) lecture "Introduction to Statistics and R". The tasks, details and some markdown structures were created by him and his team. Answers were created by me in 2022.

- Data Mining:
  The code in the [Data Mining Lecture](https://github.com/LucaWitte/ML-and-Statistics/tree/main/Data%20Mining%20Lecture) was created for [Prof. Karsten Borgwardt's](https://bsse.ethz.ch/mlcb/karsten/profile-karsten.html) lecture "Data Mining". The tasks, details and some skeleton code were created by him and his team. Answers were created by me in 2022. 


Many thanks to anyone involved in creating these courses and exercises, which helped me a lot to develop my coding and statistics skills! The education at D-BSSE is awesome and I enjoyed diving into new fields :)
