# Machine-Learning & Statistics
Coding exercises from studying and implementing ML 

- Statistics and R:
  The code in the folder [R_StatisticsLecture](https://github.com/LucaWitte/ML-and-Statistics/tree/main/R_StatisticsLectures) was created for [Dr. Jack Kuiper's](https://bsse.ethz.ch/cbg/group/people/person-detail.MjA3Mjc0.TGlzdC81MTYsOTQ0ODM3Mzc2.html) lecture "Introduction to Statistics and R". The tasks, details and some markdown structures were created by him and his team. Answers were created by me in 2022.

- Data Mining:
  The code in the folder [Data Mining Lecture](https://github.com/LucaWitte/ML-and-Statistics/tree/main/Data%20Mining%20Lecture) was created for [Prof. Karsten Borgwardt's](https://bsse.ethz.ch/mlcb/karsten/profile-karsten.html) lecture "Data Mining". The tasks, details and some skeleton code were created by him and his team. Answers were created by me in 2022.

- Statistical Models in Computational Biology:
  The code in the folder [Statistical Models in Computational Biology](https://github.com/LucaWitte/ML-and-Statistics/tree/main/Statistical%20Models%20in%20Computational%20Biology) was created for [Dr. Jack Kuiper's](https://bsse.ethz.ch/cbg/group/people/person-detail.MjA3Mjc0.TGlzdC81MTYsOTQ0ODM3Mzc2.html) and [Prof. Niko Beerenwinkel's](https://bsse.ethz.ch/cbg/group/people/person-detail.html?persid=149417) lecture "Statistical Models in Computational Biology". The tasks, details and some skeleton code were created by Niko's team. Answers were created in a group in 2023, therefore I am only uploading parts of the solutions. 

Many thanks to anyone involved in creating these courses and exercises, which helped me a lot to develop my coding and statistics skills! The education at D-BSSE is awesome and I enjoyed diving into new fields :)
